Project Reflections

How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?
- I started by making a main loop which allowed me to choose between the product, courier or orders menu.
- Within each menu, i used if and elif statements to match what the user inputs.
- From this i was able to carry out the requirements under each if/elif statement and use break to end the loop.

How did you guarantee the project's requirements?
- I followed the pseudo code and checked over each line of it to make sure all the tasks were completed.
- I also asked the instructors when i did not understand a certain requirement and also demonstrated my code to check if there
were any mistakes.

If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?
- One thing i would improve on is the use of more functions.
- I found that in my code, there were times where i was using the same code again but only changing one or two variables which
made my code look very long and hard to read.
- Therefore by adding more functions i would be able to shorten the length of my file while also making it more presentable.
This would also make it easier to do more unit testings.

What did you most enjoy implementing?
- I enjoyed reading/writing from/to csv files.
- This is because it allowed me to save data that was inputted throughout my code.
- It also gave an insight into how to manage data and keep them secure.
